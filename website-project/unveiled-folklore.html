          <p>The Salvadoran legend of La Siguanaba says that the woman, originally called Sihuehuet (beautiful woman),
            was
            a
            peasant girl that ascended to queen using her charms (and a witch's brew) to lure into marriage Tlaloc's
            son,
            Yeisun, who was a Nahuatl prince. After marriage, when her husband went to war, she had affairs with other
            men,
            and Cipitio was the child of this relationship. Sihuehuet was a bad mother, neglecting her son, leaving him
            alone
            to meet her lovers. To inherit the throne she concocted a plot to use another magic potion to poison Yeisun
            during
            a festival, and so claim the throne for her lover.[12]

            But the plan worked too well. Yeisun was transformed into a savage giant monster with two heads, who ravaged
            the
            attendants to the palace's feast. The guard struggled and defeated the creature, ending Yeisun's life. When
            Tlaloc
            found out about this, he sought the help of the almighty god, Teotl whom condemned and cursed Sihuehuet: She
            would
            be called Sihuanaba ("hideous woman"); she would be beautiful at first sight, but she would turn into a
            horrible
            abomination after luring her victims to isolated gorges. She was forced to wander the countryside, appearing
            to
            men who travelled alone at night. She is supposed to be seen at night in the rivers of El Salvador, washing
            clothes and always looking for her son, Cipitio, who was also cursed by Teotl to remain a boy for eternity.

          <p>According to the legend, he is the product of a forbidden romance between Sihuehuet, goddess of the moon,
            commonly known as La Siguanaba, and Lucero de la ma√±ana (Lucifer). When Sihuehuet's husband found out about
            this
            affair, he sought the assistance of the god Teotl. Both the queen and Cipitio were cursed and condemned by
            Teotl.
            Cipitio was condemned to live eternity as a small boy with his feet set in a backwards position to serve as
            reminder of the twisted and illicit affair of his parents. Stories are told of farmers that come to their
            fields
            and find the footsteps of a boy. They decide to follow them but eventually get lost because unbeknownst to
            them
            Cipitio has backwards feet and so they head in the wrong direction into the bush.[1]

            Cipitio is said to enjoy eating ashes, throwing pebbles at beautiful ladies, and preferring to eat a variety
            of
            banana called Guineo Majoncho. He can also teleport anywhere he wants.</p>

          <p>In Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica, and Nicaragua, the dog-like creature is known as El
            Cadejo. It
            is said to look like a dog, has deer-like hooves, and moves like a deer. The white cadejos are benevolent
            and
            eat
            bell-like flowers that only grow on volcanoes. The white cadejo protects people, including drunks,

            people with grudges from all evil footsteps, even La Siguanaba, and bad choices, which are sometimes caused
            by
            the
            cruel black cadejo. The black cadejo is malevolent and lures people to make bad choices. The black cadejo

          <p>This wagon appeared to a gossipy woman named Cirinla. It was a normal-sized wagon without oxen, but on the
            tips
            of
            the sticks that made up the stake it carried a human skull with a grotesque grin. The load of the wagon
            consisted
            of a pile of decapitated and bloody corpses that writhed like the tentacles of a thousand octopuses. The
            mule
            drivers, instead of a head, had a bunch of grass tied poorly, in their left hand they secured a sharp cuma
            and
            in
            their right hand a huge black whip, they danced as if they were dancing on hot fathoms, and with infernal
            laughter, they made whips explode. They sounded like furious lightning bolts on the flesh of those bodies;
            Behind
            her advanced strange beings with bald and flat heads, without a nose and a very wrinkled face, with a
            tremendous
            toothless snout, they shouted the names of all the people in the town who were liars, false and hypocrites.
            And
            as
            he said the names, the blows sounded like gunshots on the naked backs of the tortured bodies.

            Cirinla's curiosity was such that when she heard the noise of the Witch wagon she left her house to see it
            and
            her
            horror was so great that the next day she woke up dead in a pool of her own blood as a curious, gossipy,
            unruly,
            critical and judge And since then the Witch wagon could no longer be heard rolling on the cobbled floor of
            the
            streets of the peaceful little town.</p>

          <p>The origin of the legend of El Padre Sin Cabeza, or the headless priest can be traced to the Spanish
            colonization
            of El Salvador. In the Salvadoran version of the legend of the headless priest, he is the spirit of a priest
            that
            died in sin and without confession. Some say he had an affair and now his spirit roams the streets, cursed
            for
            eternity.

            Others say the spirit of the headless priest was killed during a revolt, he was fighting side by side with
            oppressed campesinos. After being captured, he was decapitated by the authoritative government of the time.

            Legend tells that the spirit of the headless priest can be seen leaving the front doors of a church, on
            Friday
            nights, especially during a New Moon. In San Salvador, the capital of El Salvador, he can be seen going from
            church to church, but in towns with only one church he wanders the streets and before the night is over, he
            can
            be
            seen entering the church again, through the church‚Äôs closed doors. Many claim to see him go through the
            doors
            and
            disappear in the bell tower of a church.

            Those who have seen this spirit, say that he is very tall, but missing his head. He is always holding a
            rosary
            in
            his hand and it is said only those out late at night encounter him. They feel a bone-chilling cold breeze
            and
            cannot speak from fear, for a few days after seeing him.

            They say he is searching for his head, and often appears at churches where priests have died in suspicious
            circumstances.

            Some say that if if you are out, late at night, a door to a church appears, seemingly out of nowhere, in
            front
            of
            you. Something compels you to enter the church and can hear a priest singing. The person (who is assumed to
            be
            full of sins) stays and when it is time for the consecration, the priest turns around and has no head and
            his
            hands are full of blood.

            Older folks tell stories of el padre sin cabeza appearing beneath leafy trees and frightening victims to the
            point
            they turn their lives around for the better.</p>

          <p>He is a being that causes panic, whoever imagines that the devil appears to them dies of fear, since they
            imagine
            him as a monster, but as you know the devil is an intelligent demon, it would be absurd for him to present
            himself
            as an ugly animal would present itself in the most attractive way possible.

            They say that a long time ago some owners of farms suddenly disappeared and some later appeared in the
            pastures
            dead and inside nothing but grass, they say that when bad luck surrounded some people or for reasons of life
            a
            man
            became desperate, They invoked the devil for help.

            Without waiting, a thick whirlpool formed and a rider appeared, very elegant on a powerful horse, with shiny
            saddles and a large cape. His business was to buy souls. He granted some wishes to whoever invoked him in
            exchange
            for his soul. They say that the He offered money, women, luck, a future for his children and riches in
            exchange
            for his soul.

            The gentleman gave his clients seven years to enjoy everything he offered and came after seven years to take
            the
            soul he had purchased.</p>
